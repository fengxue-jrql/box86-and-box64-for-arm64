1.About using the platform: applicable to arm64 Debian and linuxdeploy chroot arm64 debianã€‚
2.Arm64 Linux system needs multi architecture support. First sudo dpkg -- add architecture armhf, and then sudo apt update updates your software source.
3.Install the following dependent library box86 to run normally on arm64:
sudo apt install zenity:armhf libasound*:armhf libstdc++6:armhf mesa*:armhf
4.For box64:sudo apt install mesa* zenity*
5.After completing the dependency library, use sudo dpkg - I. / * Deb install the two Debs I provided
6.About environment variables: you need to write the following environment variables in / etc / profile
#Please add to the end of / etc / profile
export BOX86_PATH=~/wine/bin/
export BOX86_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/wine/lib/wine/i386-unix/:/lib/i386-linux-gnu:/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/
export BOX64_PATH=~/wine64/bin/
export BOX64_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/wine64/lib/i386-unix/:~/wine64/lib/wine/x86_64-unix/:/lib/i386-linux-gnu/:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/
7.Make environment variables effective immediately:/ Etc / profile. There is no need to restart the machine.
8.Please go to the official playonlinux repository to download wine32 and wine64
9.Now I will make a demonstration with wine32 7.0 RC and wine64 6.14 of playonlinux.
cp PlayOnLinux-wine-7.0-rc4-upstream-linux-x86.tar.gz ~
cp PlayOnLinux-wine-6.14-upstream-linux-amd64.tar.gz ~
cd ~
mkdr wine
mkdir wine64
mv PlayOnLinux-wine-7.0-rc4-upstream-linux-x86.tar.gz ~/wine
cd ~/wine
tar -xvf PlayOnLinux-wine-7.0-rc4-upstream-linux-x86.tar.gz
rm -rf PlayOnLinux-wine-7.0-rc4-upstream-linux-x86.tar.gz
cd ~
mv PlayOnLinux-wine-6.14-upstream-linux-amd64.tar.gz ~/wine64
cd ~/wine64
tar -xvf PlayOnLinux-wine-6.14-upstream-linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm -rf PlayOnLinux-wine-6.14-upstream-linux-amd64.tar.gz
Now you can use box86 and box64 on arm64.
